# Todo List

Simple todo list React/Express demo application

## Requirements

### Minimum

- [x] Use React or NextJS for the FrontEnd

- [ ] Use a CSS framework of your choice

- [ ] Use a CSS convention of your choice (Preprocessors, Modules, CSS-in-JS, etc.)

- [ ] Implement all CRUD actions

- [ ] Implement routing

- [x] Implement a Node/Express Backend

- [ ] Setup a few CRUD routes/endpoints for the app

- [ ] No need for a datastore, you can just echo back static results

### Bonus

- [ ] Add a persistence layer
- [ ] Deploy the application

## The Plan

- [x] Leverage Create React App to get up and running quickly
- [x] Leverage Express generator to get up and running quickly
- [x] Install Tailwind CSS (going to be a first for me)
- [ ] Install React Router
- [ ] Setup REST API (CRUD) for Todo items (/items, /items/:id) w/ in-memory storage
- [ ] Build Item component
- [ ] Build ItemList component
- [ ] Build ItemForm component
- [ ] Display ItemForm at bottom of screen, ItemList at top of screen
- [ ] Editing item routes to ItemForm pre-populated with current item data
- [ ] Submitting ItemForm (edit) updates item
- [ ] Submitting ItemForm (new) creates item
- [ ] Deleting item deletes item
- [ ] Finalize tests
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase (another first for me)
- [ ] Handle CORS issues?
- [ ] Add sqlite/postgres/noSQL persistence layer (knex?)
