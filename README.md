# Todo List

Simple todo list React/Express demo application

## Requirements

### Minimum

- [x] Use React or NextJS for the FrontEnd

- [x] Use a CSS framework of your choice

- [x] Use a CSS convention of your choice (Preprocessors, Modules, CSS-in-JS, etc.)

- [x] Implement all CRUD actions

- [x] Implement routing

- [x] Implement a Node/Express Backend

- [x] Setup a few CRUD routes/endpoints for the app

- [x] No need for a datastore, you can just echo back static results

### Bonus

- [ ] Deploy the application

## The Plan

- [x] Leverage Create React App to get up and running quickly
- [x] Leverage Express generator to get up and running quickly
- [ ] Install Tailwind CSS (going to be a first for me)

- [x] Setup REST API (CRUD) for Todo items (/items, /items/:id) w/ in-memory storage
- [x] Build Item component
- [x] Build ItemList component
- [x] Build ItemForm component
- [x] Display ItemForm at bottom of screen, ItemList at top of screen
- [x] Editing item routes to ItemForm pre-populated with current item data
- [x] Submitting ItemForm (edit) updates item
- [x] Submitting ItemForm (new) creates item
- [x] Deleting item deletes item
- [ ] Finalize tests
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase (another first for me)
- [ ] Handle CORS issues?
- [ ] Add sqlite/postgres/noSQL persistence layer (knex?)
